<b>The object-reading preference in doubly-gapped Mandarin relatives</b><br>
It is observed in doubly-gapped Mandarin relatives that an object reading is preferred
over a subject reading. Showing both null subjects and null objects undergo movements, I argue
that this preference for object readings over subject readings is attributed to the general preference
for nested movements over crossing movements.<br>

<b>Verbal reduplication and the one-delimitation principle</b><br>
This paper argues that the incompatibility between Mandarin verbal reduplications and several post-verbal result-denoting elements is one of the cases of the one-delimitation principle. 
The discussion of Mandarin verbal reduplication shows that (i) the one-delimitation principle not only applies to resultatives but also other result-denoting elements; (ii) vP is the domain for the one-delimitation principle.<br>

<b>limited ellipsis and presupposition</b><br>
This study examines the non-verbal wh-question (NVWQ) in Mandarin as a case of the limited ellipsis of the existence predicate V<sup>BE</sup>, and argues the D-linked presupposition of what-N phrases in NVWQ
could function similarly as an “appropriate discourse context” to license the ellipsis of the existence predicate V<sup>BE</sup>.<br>

	<b>The concessive readings of Mandarin scalar particle hai</b><br>
	      Mandarin concessive hai is observed to always co-occur
with shi. I propose that Mandarin concessive hai presupposes a public-biased opinion favoring the negative alternative
to the proposition to which hai is attached, which consequently triggers
the presence of the verum focus marker shi.<br>

        <b>The antecedent preferences for Mandarin reflexive <i>ziji</i> and <i>ta-ziji</i> [joint work with Dorothy Ahn] </b><br>
	      We conducted forced-choice and naturalness-judgment experiments to test whether <i>ziji</i> and <i>ta-ziji</i>  differ in antecedent preferences when two possible antecedents are present and differ in relative saliency.<br>

	     <b> Two Effects of the Utterance-final Particle <i>hao-bu-hao</i> in Mandarin Chinese.</b><br>
The utterance-final particle <i>hao-bu-hao</i>   ‘good-not-good’ in Mandarin Chinese has two effects: requesting and emphasizing the mutually known fact. I provide an account of these two effects with the focus on their commonalities and
dissimilarities, accounting for why one single particle can derive two different effects.<br>
